# Gatsby Starter - Converting Gatsby Starter Blog to Builder.io

This is my personal approach for generating a project using the [Builder.io Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/BuilderIO/gatsby-starter-builder) and update it to:

- Use TypeScript
- Use Styled Components
- Deploy to Netlify
- Continuous Deployment with Builder.io and Netlify
